# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

# Background
Task at hand was a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s, at Pewlett Hackard. All that remain of 
the database of employees from that period are six CSV files, located in the Resources Folder.
During this assigment tables were designed to hold data in the CSVs, CSVs were imported into a SQL database, and then questions were answered about the data. Thus, what was done were:


 * Data Modeling 
 * Data Engineering
 * Data Analysis
  
# Data Analysis
#The following was perfromed during data analysis:
  #1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.
  #2. List employees who were hired in 1986.
  #3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee          #number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.
  #4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  #5. List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
  #6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  #7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, 
      #and   department name.
  #8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.


#During data eximation, there is a suspicion that the dataset is fake. To confirm this hunch, the following steps were taken to generate a visualization of the data:

  #1. Import the SQL database into Pandas. 
  #2. Create a bar chart of average salary by title.
